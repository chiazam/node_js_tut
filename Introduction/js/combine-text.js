// It was within this landscape of technology that Sir Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web, and Brendan Eich created JavaScript. Designed for coders familiar with HTML tags, JavaScript was a way to move beyond static pages of text with animation and interactivity. Given its familiar setting of a webpage, JavaScript makes high-level tasks easy. Web pages are filled with text and tags, so combining two strings is easy.
const s1 = "first string";
const s2 = "second string";
let s3 = s1 + s2;
